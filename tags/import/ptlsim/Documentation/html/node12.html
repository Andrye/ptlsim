<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION04310000000000000000">
Resource Allocation</A>
</H1>

<P>
During the Allocate stage, PTLsim dequeues uops from the fetch queue,
ensures all resources needed by those uops are free, and assigns resources
to each uop as needed. These resources include Reorder Buffer (ROB)
slots, physical registers and load store queue (LSQ) entries. In the
event that the fetch queue is empty or any of the ROB, physical register
file, load queue or store queue is full, the allocation stage stalls
until some resources become available.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION04320000000000000000">
Reorder Buffer Entries</A>
</H1>

<P>
The Reorder Buffer (ROB) in the PTLsim out of order model works exactly
like a traditional ROB: as a queue, entries are allocated from the
tail and committed from the head. Each <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">ReorderBufferEntry</FONT></TT>
structure is the central tracking structure for uops in the pipeline.
This structure contains a variety of fields including:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The decoded uop (<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">uop</FONT></TT> field). This is the fully decoded
<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">TransOp</FONT></TT> augmented with fetch-related information like
the uop's UUID, RIP and branch predictor information as described
in the Fetch stage (Section <A HREF="node11.html#sec:FetchStage">7.1</A>).
</LI>
<LI>Current state of the ROB entry and uop (<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">current_state_list</FONT></TT>;
see below)
</LI>
<LI>Indices of the physical register (<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">physreg</FONT></TT>), LSQ entry
(<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">lsq</FONT></TT>) and other resources allocated to the uop
</LI>
<LI>Indices of the three physical register operands to the uop, as well
as a possible store dependency used in replay scheduling (described
later)
</LI>
<LI>Various cycle counters and related fields for simulating progress
through the pipeline
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION04321000000000000000">
ROB States</A>
</H2>

<P>
Each ROB entry and corresponding uop can be in one of a number of
states describing its progress through the simulator state machine.
ROBs are linked into linked lists according to their current state;
these lists are named <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">rob_</FONT></TT><I>statename</I><TT><FONT SIZE="-1">_list</FONT></TT>.
The <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">current_state_list</FONT></TT> field specifies the list
the ROB is currently on. ROBs can be moved between states using the
<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">ROB::changestate(</FONT><I><FONT SIZE="-1">statelist</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="-1">)</FONT></TT>
method. The specific states will be described below as they are encountered.

<P>
<B><I>NOTE:</I></B> the terms ``ROB entry'' (singular) and ``uop''
are used interchangeably from now on unless otherwise stated, since
there is a 1:1 mapping between the two.

Physical Registers
</H1>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION04331000000000000000">
Physical Registers</A>
</H2>

<P>
Physical registers are represented in PTLsim by the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">PhysicalRegister</FONT></TT>
structure. Physical registers store several components:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The actual 64-bit register data
</LI>
<LI>x86 flags: Z, P, S, O, C. These are discussed below in Section <A HREF="node8.html#sub:FlagsManagement">5.6</A>.
</LI>
<LI>Waiting flag (<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">FLAG_WAIT</FONT></TT>) for results not yet ready
</LI>
<LI>Invalid flag (<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">FLAG_INVAL</FONT></TT>) for ready results which
encountered an exception. The exception code is written to the data
field in lieu of the real result.
</LI>
<LI>Current state of the physical register
</LI>
<LI>ROB currently owning this physical register, or architectural register
mapping this physical register
</LI>
<LI>Reference counter for the physical register. This is required for
reasons described in Section <A HREF="node18.html#sub:PhysicalRegisterRecyclingComplications">14.4</A>.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION04332000000000000000">
Physical Register File</A>
</H2>

<P>
PTLsim models a unified physical register file holding both integer
and floating point results; this is required because presently many
PTL uops assume both types of registers are accessible as operands
to a single uop.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION04333000000000000000">
Physical Register States</A>
</H2>

<P>
Each physical register can be in one of several states at any given
time; PTLsim maintains linked lists (the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">physreg_</FONT></TT><I>statename</I><TT><FONT SIZE="-1">_list</FONT></TT>
lists) to track which registers are in each state. The <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">current_state_list</FONT></TT>
field in each physical register specifies this state. The valid states
are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B><I>free:</I></B> the register is not allocated to any uop.
</LI>
<LI><B><I>used:</I></B> the register has been allocated to a uop but
that uop has not issued yet.
</LI>
<LI><B><I>ready:</I></B> the uop associated with the register has issued
and produced a value (or encountered an exception), but that value
is only on the bypass network - it has not actually been written back
yet. For simulation purposes only, uops immediately write their results
into the physical register as soon as they issue, even though technically
the result is still only on the bypass network. This helps simplify
the simulator considerably without compromising accuracy.
</LI>
<LI><B><I>written:</I></B> the uop associated with the register has
passed through the writeback stage and the value of the physical register
is now up to date; all future consumers will read the uop's result
from this physical register.
</LI>
<LI><B><I>arch:</I></B> the physical register is currently mapped to
one of the architectural registers; it has no associated uop currently
in the pipeline
</LI>
<LI><B><I>pendingfree:</I></B> this is a special state described in
Section <A HREF="node18.html#sub:PhysicalRegisterRecyclingComplications">14.4</A>.
</LI>
</UL>
One physical register is allocated to each uop and moved into the
<I>used</I> state, regardless of which type of uop it is. For integer,
floating point and load uops, the physical register holds the actual
numerical value generated by the corresponding uop. Branch uops place
the target RIP of the branch in a physical register. Store uops place
the physical address in the register. Technically branches and stores
do not need physical registers, but to keep the processor design simple,
they are allocated registers anyway.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION04340000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:LoadStoreQueueEntry"></A>
<BR>
Load Store Queue Entries
</H1>

<P>
Load Store Queue (LSQ) Entries (the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">LoadStoreQueueEntry</FONT></TT>
structure in PTLsim) are used to track additional information about
loads and stores in the pipeline that cannot be represented by a physical
register. Specifically, LSQ entries track:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Physical address</B> of the corresponding load or store
</LI>
<LI><B>Data</B> field (64 bits) stores the loaded value (for loads)
or the value to store (for stores)
</LI>
<LI><B>Address valid</B> bit flag indicates if the load or store knows
its effective physical address yet. If set, the physical address field
is valid.
</LI>
<LI><B>Data valid</B> bit flag indicates if the data field is valid.
For loads, this is set when the data has arrived from the cache. For
stores, this is set when the data to store becomes ready and is merged.
</LI>
<LI><B>Invalid</B> bit flag is set if an exception occurs in the corresponding
load or store.
</LI>
</UL>
The <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">LoadStoreQueueEntry</FONT></TT> structure is technically a
superset of a structure known as an <I>SFR</I> (Store Forwarding Register),
which completely represents any load or store and can be passed between
PTLsim subsystems easily. One LSQ entry is allocated to each load
or store during the Allocate stage.

<P>
In real processors, the load queue (LDQ) and store queue (STQ) are
physically separate for circuit complexity reasons. However, in PTLsim
a unified LSQ is used to make searching operations easier. One additional
bit flag (<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">store</FONT></TT> bit) specifies whether an LSQ entry
is a load or store.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION04341000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sub:RegisterRenaming"></A>
<BR>
Register Renaming
</H2>

<P>
The basic register renaming process in the PTLsim x86 model is very
similar to classical register renaming, with the exception of the
flags complications described in Section <A HREF="node8.html#sub:FlagsManagement">5.6</A>.
Two versions of the register rename table (RRT) are maintained: a
<I>speculative RRT</I> which is updated as uops are renamed, and a
<I>commit RRT</I>, which is only updated when uops successfully commit.
Since the simulator implements a unified physical and architectural
register file, the commit process does not actually involve any data
movement between physical and architectural registers: only the commit
RRT needs to be updated. The commit RRT is used only for exception
and branch mispredict recovery, since it holds the last known good
mapping of architectural to physical registers.

<P>
Each rename table contains 80 entries as shown in Table <A HREF="#table:ArchitecturalRegisters">8.1</A>.
This table maps architectural registers and pseudo-registers to the
most up to date physical registers for the following:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>16 x86-64 integer registers
</LI>
<LI>16 128-bit SSE registers (represented as separate 64-bit high and
low halves)
</LI>
<LI>ZAPS, CF, OF flag sets described in Section <A HREF="node8.html#sub:FlagsManagement">5.6</A>.
These rename table entries point to the physical register (with attached
flags) of the most recent uop in program order to update any or all
of the ZAPS, CF, OF flag sets, respectively.
</LI>
<LI>Various integer and x87 status registers
</LI>
<LI>Temporary pseudo-registers <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">temp0</FONT></TT>-<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">temp7</FONT></TT>
not visible to x86 code but required to hold temporaries (e.g. generated
addresses or value to swap in <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">xchg</FONT></TT> instructions).
</LI>
<LI>Special fixed values, e.g. <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">zero</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">imm</FONT></TT>
(value is in immediate field), <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">mem</FONT></TT> (destination of
stores)

<P>
Once the uop's three architectural register sources are mapped to
physical registers, these physical registers are placed in the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">operands[</FONT></TT>0,1,2<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">]</FONT></TT>
fields. The fourth operand field, <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">operands[</FONT></TT>3<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">]</FONT></TT>,
is used to hold a store buffer dependency for loads and stores; this
will be discussed later. The speculative RRT entries for both the
destination physical register and any modified flags are then overwritten.
Finally, the ROB is moved into the <B><I>frontend</I></B> state.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION04342000000000000000">
External State</A>
</H2>

<P>
Since the rest of the simulator outside of the out of order core does
not know about the RRTs and expects architectural registers to be
in a standardized format, the system-wide <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">ctx</FONT></TT> structure
of class <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">CoreState</FONT></TT> is used to house the architectural
register file. The <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">REG_flags</FONT></TT> and <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">REG_rip</FONT></TT>
entries of this structure are directly updated by the out of order
core as instructions commit.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION04350000000000000000">
Frontend Stages</A>
</H1>

<P>
To simulate various processor frontend pipeline depths, ROBs are placed
in the <I>frontend</I> state for a user-selectable number of cycles.
In the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">frontend()</FONT></TT> function, the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">cycles_left</FONT></TT>
field in each ROB is decremented until it becomes zero. At this point,
the uop is moved to the <B><I>ready_to_dispatch</I></B> state.
This feature can be used to simulate various branch mispredict penalties
by setting the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">FRONTEND_STAGES</FONT></TT> constant.
