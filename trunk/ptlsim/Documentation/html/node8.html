Micro-Ops (uops) and TransOps
</H1>

<P>
PTLsim presents to user code a full implementation of the x86 and
x86-64 instruction set (both 32-bit and 64-bit modes), including most
user level instructions supported by the Intel Pentium 4 and AMD K8
microprocessors (i.e. all standard instructions, SSE/SSE2, x86-64
and most of x87 FP). At the present stage of development, the vast
majority of all userspace instructions are implemented. 

<P>
The x86 instruction set is based on the two-operand CISC concept of
load-and-compute and load-compute-store. However, modern x86 processors
(including PTLsim) do not directly execute complex x86 instructions.
Instead, these processors translate each x86 instruction into a series
of micro-operations (<I>uops</I>) very similar to classical load-store
RISC instructions. Uops can be executed very efficiently on an out
of order core, unlike x86 instructions. In PTLsim, uops have three
source registers and one destination register. They may generate a
64-bit result and various x86 status flags, or may be loads, stores
or branches.

<P>
The x86 instruction decoding process initially generates translated
uops (<I>transops</I>), which have a slightly different structure
than the true uops used in the processor core. Specifically, sources
and destinations are represented as un-renamed architectural registers
(or special temporary register numbers), and a variety of additional
information is attached to each uop only needed during the renaming
and retirement process. TransOps (represented by the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">TransOp</FONT></TT>
structure) consist of the following:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT><FONT SIZE="-1">som</FONT></TT>: Start of Macro-Op. Since x86 instructions may
consist of multiple transops, the first transop in the sequence has
its <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">som</FONT></TT> bit set to indicate this.
</LI>
<LI><TT><FONT SIZE="-1">eom</FONT></TT>: End of Macro-Op. This bit is set for the last
transop in a given x86 instruction (which may also be the first uop
for single-uop instructions)
</LI>
<LI><TT><FONT SIZE="-1">bytes</FONT></TT>: Number of bytes in the corresponding x86 instruction
(1-15). This is only valid for a SOM uop.
</LI>
<LI><TT><FONT SIZE="-1">opcode</FONT></TT>: the uop (not x86) opcode
</LI>
<LI><TT><FONT SIZE="-1">size</FONT></TT>: the effective operation size (0-3, for 1/2/4/8
bytes)
</LI>
<LI><TT><FONT SIZE="-1">cond:</FONT></TT> the x86 condition code for branches, selects,
sets, etc. For loads and stores, this field is reused to specify unaligned
access information as described later.
</LI>
<LI><TT><FONT SIZE="-1">setflags</FONT></TT>: subset of the x86 flags set by this uop
(see Section <A HREF="#sub:FlagsManagement">5.6</A>)
</LI>
<LI><TT><FONT SIZE="-1">internal</FONT></TT>: set for certain microcode operations. For
instance, loads and stores marked internal access on-chip registers
or buffers invisible to x86 code (e.g. machine state registers, segmentation
caches, floating point constant tables, etc).
</LI>
<LI><TT><FONT SIZE="-1">rd</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">ra</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">rb</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">rc</FONT></TT>:
the architectural source and destination registers (see Section <A HREF="node12.html#sub:RegisterRenaming">8.4.1</A>)
</LI>
<LI><TT><FONT SIZE="-1">extshift</FONT></TT>: shift amount (0-3 bits) used for shifted
adds (x86 memory addressing and LEA). The <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">rc</FONT></TT> operand
is shifted left by this amount.
</LI>
<LI><TT><FONT SIZE="-1">cachelevel</FONT></TT>: used for prefetching and non-temporal
loads and stores
</LI>
<LI><TT><FONT SIZE="-1">rbimm</FONT></TT> and <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">rcimm</FONT></TT>: signed 64-bit immediates
for the rb and rc operands. These are selected by specifying the special
constant <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">REG_imm</FONT></TT> in the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">rb</FONT></TT> and <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">rc</FONT></TT>
fields, respectively.
</LI>
<LI><TT><FONT SIZE="-1">riptaken</FONT></TT>: for branches only, the 64-bit target RIP
of the branch if it were taken.
</LI>
<LI><TT><FONT SIZE="-1">ripseq</FONT></TT>: for branches only, the 64-bit sequential RIP
of the branch if it were not taken.
</LI>
</UL>
There may be other fields used for debugging or not relevant to the
out of order version of the simulator; these should be ignored.

Descriptions of uops</A>
</H1>

<P>
Section <A HREF="node22.html#sec:UopReference">17</A> describes the semantics and encoding
of all uops supported by the PTLsim processor model.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION03130000000000000000">
Simple Fast Path Instructions</A>
</H1>

<P>
Simple integer and floating point operations are fairly straightforward
to decode into loads, stores and ALU operations; a typical load-op-store
ALU operation will consist of a load to fetch one operand, the ALU
operation itself, and a store to write the result. The instruction
set also implements a number of important but complex instructions
with bizarre semantics; typically the translator will synthesize and
inject into the uop stream up to 8 uops for more complex instructions. 

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION03140000000000000000">
x86-64</A>
</H1>

<P>
The 64-bit x86-64 instruction set is a fairly straightforward extension
of the 32-bit IA-32 (x86) instruction set. The x86-64 ISA was introduced
by AMD in 2000 with its K8 microarchitecture; the same instructions
were subsequently plagiarized by Intel under a different name several
years later. In addition to extending all integer registers and ALU
datapaths to 64 bits, x86-64 also provides a total of 16 integer general
purpose registers and 16 SSE (vector floating and fixed point) registers.
It also introduced several 64-bit address space simplifications, including
RIP-relative addressing and corresponding new addressing modes, and
eliminated a number of legacy features from 64-bit mode, including
segmentation, BCD arithmetic, some byte register manipulation, etc.
Limited forms of segmentation are still present to allow thread local
storage and mark code segments as 64-bit. In general, the encoding
of x86-64 and x86 are very similar, with 64-bit mode adding a one
byte REX prefix to specify additional bits for source and destination
register indexes and effective address size. As a result, both variants
can be decoded by similar decoding logic into a common set of uops.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION03150000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:OperationSizes"></A>
<BR>
Operation Sizes
</H1>

<P>
Most x86-64 instructions can operate on 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits of a
given register. For 8-bit and 16-bit operations, only the low 8 or
16 bits of the destination register are actually updated; 32-bit and
64-bit operations are zero extended as with RISC architectures. As
a result, a dependency on the old destination register may be introduced
so merging can be performed. Fortunately, since x86 features destructive
overwrites of the destination register (i.e. the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">rd</FONT></TT>
and <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">ra</FONT></TT> operands are the same), the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">ra</FONT></TT>
operand is generally already a dependency. Thus, the PT2x uop encoding
reserves 2 bits to specify the operation size; the low bits of the
new result are automatically merged with the old destination value
(in <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">ra</FONT></TT>) as part of the ALU logic. This applies to
the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">mov</FONT></TT> uop as well, allowing operations like ``<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">mov
al,bl</FONT></TT>'' in one uop. Loads do not support this mode, so loads into
8-bit and 16-bit registers must be followed by a separate <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">mov</FONT></TT>
uop to truncate and merge the loaded value into the old destination
properly.

<P>
The x86 ISA defines some bizarre byte operations as a carryover from
the ancient 8086 architecture; for instance, it is possible to address
the second byte of many integer registers as a separate register (i.e.
as <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">ah</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">bh</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">ch</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">dh</FONT></TT>).
The <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">inshb</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">exthb</FONT></TT> and <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">movhb</FONT></TT>
uops are provided for handling this rare but important operation.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION03160000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sub:FlagsManagement"></A>
<BR>
Flags Management and Register Renaming
</H1>

<P>
Many x86 arithmetic instructions modify some or all of the processor's
numerous status and condition flag bits, but only 5 are relevant to
normal execution: Zero, Parity, Sign, Overflow, Carry. In accordance
with the well-known ``ZAPS rule'', any instruction that updates
any of the Z/P/S flags updates all three flags, so in reality only
three flag entities need to be tracked: ZPS, O, F (``ZAPS'' also
includes an Auxiliary flag not accessible by most modern user instructions;
it is irrelevant to the discussion below).

<P>
The x86 flag update semantics can hamper out of order execution, so
we use a simple and well known solution. The 5 flag bits are attached
to each result and physical register (along with the invalid and waiting
bits described in Section <A HREF="node12.html#sec:PhysicalRegisters">8.3</A>); these bits
are then consumed along with the actual result value by any consumers
that also need to access the flags. It should be noted that not all
uops generate all the flags as well as a 64-bit result, and some uops
only generate flags and no result data. 

<P>
The register renaming mechanism is aware of these semantics, and tracks
the latest x86 instruction in program order to update each set of
flags (ZAPS, C, O); this allows branches and other flag consumers
to directly access the result with the most recent program-ordered
flag updates yet still allows full out of order scheduling. To do
this, x86 processors maintain three separate rename table entries
for the ZAPS, CF, OF flags in addition to the register rename table
entry, any or all of which may be updated when uops are renamed. The
<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">TransOp</FONT></TT> structure for each uop has a 3-bit <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">setflags</FONT></TT>
field filled out during decoding in accordance with x86 semantics;
the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">SETFLAG_ZF</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">SETFLAG_CF</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">SETFLAG_OF</FONT></TT>
bits in this field are used to determine which of the ZPS, O, F flag
subsets to rename.

<P>
As mentioned above, any consumer of the flags needs to consult at
most three distinct sources: the last ZAPS producer, the Carry producer
and the Overflow producer. This conveniently fits into PTLsim's three-operand
uop semantics. Various special uops access the flags associated with
an operand rather than the 64-bit operand data itself. Branches always
take two flag sources, since in x86 this is enough to evaluate any
possible condition code combination (the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">cond_code_to_flag_regs</FONT></TT>
array provides this mapping). Various ALU instructions consume only
the flags part of a source physical register; these include <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">addc</FONT></TT>
(add with carry), <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">rcl/rcr</FONT></TT> (rotate carry), <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">sel.</FONT><I><FONT SIZE="-1">cc</FONT></I></TT>
(select for conditional moves) and so on. Finally, the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">collcc</FONT></TT>
uop takes three operands (the latest producer of the ZAPS, CF and
OF flags) and merges the flag components of each operand into a single
flag set as its result. These uops are all documented in Section <A HREF="node22.html#sec:UopReference">17</A>.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION03170000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sub:UnalignedLoadsAndStores"></A>
<BR>
Unaligned Loads and Stores
</H1>

<P>
Compared to RISC architectures, the x86 architecture is infamous for
its relatively widespread use of unaligned memory operations; any
implementation must efficiently handle this scenario. Fortunately,
analysis shows that unaligned accesses are rarely in the performance
intensive parts of a modern program, so we can aggressively eliminate
them on contact through rescheduling. PTLsim does this by initially
causing all unaligned loads and stores to raise an <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">UnalignedAccess</FONT></TT>
internal exception, forcing a rollback of the current trace. To locate
the RIP of the offending x86 instruction, the sequential version of
the trace is then executed until the unaligned access is encountered
again. At this point, a special ``unaligned'' bit is set for the
problem load or store in its translated basic block representation.
The sequential basic block is then retranslated such that when the
x86 instruction with the problem RIP is encountered, the offending
load or store is split into two aligned loads or stores.

<P>
PTLsim includes special uops to handle loads and stores split into
two in this manner. The <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">ld.lo</FONT></TT> uop rounds down its
effective address <!-- MATH
 $\left\lfloor A\right\rfloor$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$\left\lfloor A\right\rfloor $"> to the nearest 64-bit
boundary and performs the load. The <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">ld.hi</FONT></TT> uop rounds
up to <!-- MATH
 $\left\lceil A+8\right\rceil$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="63" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$\left\lceil A+8\right\rceil $">, performs another load, then
takes as its third rc operand the first (<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">ld.lo</FONT></TT>) load's
result. The two loads are concatenated into a 128-bit word and the
final unaligned data is extracted. Stores are handled in a similar
manner, with <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">st.lo</FONT></TT> and <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">st.hi</FONT></TT> rounding
down and up to store parts of the unaligned value in adjacent 64-bit
blocks. Just as with normal loads and stores, these unaligned load
or store pairs access separate store buffers for each half as if they
were independent.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION03180000000000000000">
Repeated String Operations</A>
</H1>

<P>
The x86 architecture allows for repeated string operations, including
block moves, stores, compares and scans. The iteration count of these
repeated operations depends on a combination of the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">rcx</FONT></TT>
register and the flags set by the repeated operation (e.g. compare).
To translate these instructions, PTL treats the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">rep
xxx</FONT></TT> instruction as a single basic block; any basic block in progress
before the repeat instruction is capped and the repeat is translated
as a separate basic block. This conveniently lets us unroll and optimize
the repeated loop just like any other basic block. To handle the unusual
case where the repeat count is zero, a check instruction is inserted
at the top of the loop to protect against this case; PTL simply bypasses
the offending block if the check fails.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION03190000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:ShiftRotateProblems"></A>
<BR>
Problem Instructions
</H1>

<P>
The shift and rotate instructions have some of the most bizarre semantics
in the entire x86 instruction set: they may or may not modify a subset
of the flags depending on the rotation count operand, which we may
not even know until the instruction issues. For fixed shifts and rotates,
these semantics can be preserved by the uops generated, however variable
rotations are more complex. The <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">collcc</FONT></TT> uop is put
to use here to collect all flags; the collected result is then fed
into the shift or rotate uop as its <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">rc</FONT></TT> operand; the
uop then replicates the precise x86 behavior (including rotates using
the carry flag) according to its input operands.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION031100000000000000000">
SSE Support</A>
</H1>

<P>
PTLsim provides full support for SSE and SSE2 vector floating point
and fixed point, in both scalar and vector mode. As is done in the
AMD K8, each SSE operation on a 128-bit vector is split into two 64-bit
halves; each half (possibly consisting of a 64-bit load and one or
more FPU operations) is scheduled independently. Because SSE instructions
do not set flags like x86 integer instructions, architectural state
management can be restricted to the 16 128-bit SSE registers (represented
as 32 paired 64-bit registers) and a single <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">mxcsr</FONT></TT>
architectural register containing sticky exception bits, which has
no effect on out of order execution). The processor's floating point
units can operate in either 64-bit IEEE double precision mode or on
two parallel 32-bit single precision values.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION031110000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sub:x87-Floating-Point"></A>
<BR>
x87 Floating Point
</H1>

<P>
The legacy x87 floating point architecture is the bane of all x86
processor vendors' existence, largely because its stack based nature
makes out of order processing so difficult. While there are certainly
ways of translating stack based instruction sets into flat addressing
for scheduling purposes, we do not do this. Fortunately, following
the Pentium III and AMD Athlon's introduction, x87 is rapidly headed
for planned obsolescence; most major applications released within
the last three years now use SSE instructions for their floating point
needs either exclusively or in all performance critical parts. To
this end, even Intel has relegated x86 support on the Pentium 4 to
a separate low performance in-order legacy unit, and AMD has severely
restricted its use in 64-bit mode. For this reason, PTLsim translates
legacy x87 instructions into a serialized, program ordered and emulated
form; the hardware does not contain any x87-style 80-bit floating
point registers (all floating point hardware is 32-bit and 64-bit
IEEE compliant). We have noticed little to no performance problem
from this approach when examining typical binaries, which rarely if
ever still use x87 instructions in compute-intensive code.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION031120000000000000000">
Assists</A>
</H1>

<P>
Some operations are too complex to inline directly into the uop stream.
To perform these instructions, a special uop (<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">brp</FONT></TT>:
branch private) is executed to branch to an <I>assist</I> function
implemented in microcode. In PTLsim, some assist functions are implemented
as regular C/C++ or assembly language code when they interact with
the rest of the virtual machine. Examples of instructions requiring
assists include system calls, interrupts, some forms of integer division,
handling of rare floating point conditions, CPUID, MSR reads/writes,
etc. These are listed in the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">ASSIST_xxx</FONT></TT> enum found
in <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">translate-x86.cpp</FONT></TT> and <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">ptlhwdef.h</FONT></TT>.

<P>
When the processor issues an assist (<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">brp</FONT></TT> uop), the
frontend pipeline is stalled and execution waits until the <TT><FONT SIZE="-1">brp</FONT></TT>
retires, at which point an assist function within PTLsim is called.
In a real processor there are more efficient ways of doing this without
flushing the pipeline, however in PTLsim assists are sufficiently
rare that the performance impact is negligible and this approach significantly
reduces complexity.
